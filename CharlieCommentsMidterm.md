# Comments Midterm Isit322 2017

This document contains Charlie's comments on your Isit322 2017 Midterm.

All of the problems mentioned here are fixed in the code I pushed to your **charlie-midterm** branch.

- You did not import logger in getUserInfo
- You were having trouble reading in field-definitions because you put them in a folder outside of your client project. This meant that babel was not being run over it, and hence the ES6 syntax **export default** was not working.
- Use did not pass the right URL in to **/user** server side route in **routes/api.js**
- You did not properly pass on the correct props from **DataMaven** to **ShowUserInfo**

I did not get to the tests, but fixing the above was a lot of work.

I'm a little worried about you, Kristie. If you need help, let me know. I can help you fix more technical problems in your code that I have so far this quarter. Get my attention!

I'm not going to grade this until you get the fixes in that I have given you in the **charlie-midterm branch**. You can't get more than B on this midterm, but before I give you that, I want to see that you have made the fixes I have supplied. So please resubmit with the fixes and I will give you a B or something like it.
